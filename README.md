### Some Features

* App is fully Responsive

* App is Redux-ready, with Redux and store configured and simple data fetching from our localhost server.

* The time given in application is located in '/Components/utilities/dateFilter.js' file under 'time' const variable. By changing hours, you can manage to change the outcome of schedule (currently playing, upcoming series)
    * example of changing, please see the highlighted values:
        * from : 2017-03-18T<b>16:20</b>:00+01:00 to 2017-03-18T<b>17:20</b>:00+01:00

### To Do

* Probably the name convention of DashboardView should be renamed into 'EpgView', if we want to make the Dashboard our main view and we keep in mind that in the future, there will be details pages about channels/series etc. 

* Some mixins to work with on SCSS side

* Since there is no more components (details pages etc.) to navigate to, menu is not needed for now. Yet it is pre-made and ready to be implemented
